## Question 1
``` 1
{{ Guest additions are installed on a VM in order for the guest operating system 
to run more optimally (performance, usabiltiy). I noticed that I now have an
easy interface to exchange files between my host OS and guest OS. I also noticed 
it fixed the time on my guest OS (it was inaccurate before). I also noticed that
in general my OS seems to have better performance, for exampe with loading things,
compiling things, watching videos, etc.

Q6 play around response: The basic funtionalities seem to be the same as on CAEN. 
For example, all the terminal commands I have tried have been the same.
Other similar tools include g++, running programs with ./, and basic software 
such as libreoffice writer. The UI is clearly different and it does not have 
nearly as much software and other built in functionalities and already-setup 
tools as in CAEN. For example, typing 'code readme.txt' doesn't do anything - vs 
code is not installed.   }}
```

## Question 2
``` 2
{{ My experience thus far has aligned more with unix culture for the sole reason
that I am a programmer. Before I became a programmer, I would go with Windows 
hands down. However, my computer consumption in recent years have heavily shifted 
towards programming - so the time saved from the unix design paradigms discussed 
in the article far outweigh the end-user convenience of Windows systems. 
I also think that the hands-on approach of unix systems has also helped me to 
understand my computer more than before - my Windows machine was truly a black
box to me.  }}
```

## Question 3
``` 3
{{ Firstly, I took away that command-line bullshittery is so universally
encountered by programmers that people write long articles about them. 
I also had never thought about how it can cause people to be turned off from 
computer science - indeed, I realize that it has at times turned me off of it.
However, I also agree with the sentiment that while not ideal, solving these 
low-level issues does actually build problem solving tools that help you become 
a better programmer in general. I believe that it will be a long while if ever 
that we rid ourselves of command-line bullshittery.  }}
